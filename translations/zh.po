msgid "When genetic information is used to describe or classify a taxon, most users will foresee its use in the context of molecular ecology or phylogenetic research. It is important to realize that a sequence with coordinates and a timestamp is a valuable biodiversity occurrence which is useful in a much broader context than its original purpose. To realize this potential, DNA-derived data needs to be discoverable through biodiversity data platforms. This guide will teach you the principles and approaches of exposing “sequences with dates and coordinates” in the context of broader biodiversity data. The guide covers choices of particular schemas and terms, common pitfalls and good practice, without going into platform-specific details. It will benefit anyone interested in better exposure of DNA-derived data through general biodiversity data platforms, including national biodiversity portals."

msgid "The last 20 years have brought an increased understanding of the immense power of molecular methods for documenting the diversity of life on earth. Seemingly lifeless and mundane substrates such as soil and sea water turn out to abound with life–although perhaps not in a way that the casual observer may immediately appreciate. DNA-based studies have shown that organism groups such as fungi, insects, oomycetes, bacteria and archaea are everywhere, although we often cannot observe them physically (https://doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fix023[Debroas et al. 2017^]). The benefits of molecular methods are not restricted to the microscopic world: there are many organisms, such as some fish species, which can at least theoretically be observed physically but for which it is very costly, labour-intensive, and perhaps invasive to do so (https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aap9661[Boussarie et al. 2018^]). In such situations, DNA data enable us to record the presence (and past presence) of these organisms non-invasively and with minimal effort. These developments mean that we do not always need tangible, physical manifestations of all organisms present at some site in order to record them. All organisms, whether or not they are physically observable, may be important when it comes to understanding biodiversity, ecology and biological conservation."
msgstr "在過去的20年裡，人們對分子生物方法在記錄地球上生命多樣性的能力有了更多的了解。 儘管不是以一種觀察者會立即欣賞的方式—看似沒有生命的土壤和海水等平凡的基質卻充滿了生命。基於DNA的研究證明，真菌、昆蟲、卵菌、細菌和古細菌等生物群無處不在，儘管我們無法通過實體的方式觀察它們 (https://doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fix023[Debroas et al. 2017^])。分子生物方法的好處並不局限於微觀世界：有許多生物，例如某些魚類，即使可以實體的觀察到與紀錄它們，但尋找這些生物需要高金錢與人力成本，而且對生物可能具有侵入性 (https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aap9661[Boussarie et al. 2018^])。 在這種情況下，DNA資料使我們能夠以最小的努力以非侵入性地的方式記錄這些生物的存在 (和過去存在)。 這些發展意味著我們並不總是需要在某個地點來記錄所有存在的生物體。 所有生物，無論它們是否可以實體的被觀察到，在了解生物多樣性、生態學和生物保育方面都應該很重要。"

msgid "DNA-derived data enable us to record inconspicuous or otherwise unobservable taxa that fall below the radar of vetted protocols for field work, checklists, depositions into natural science collections, etc. The current maturity of DNA methodologies enables us to record the presence of these organisms to a level of detail that exceeds that of macroscopic observations of organisms in general. However, bearing in mind that DNA methodologies comes with their own problems and biases, it is important to use this moment to define and agree how we should record and report on an organism as present in some substrate or locality through molecular data.

It does not express any view on the issue of access and benefit sharing for digital sequence information, the subject of extensive discussion through the https://www.cbd.int/abs/[Convention on Biological Diversity^] (CBD). However, it is worth noting that genetic barcodes and metabarcodes are typically genes or non-coding DNA fragments, which are not suitable for commercial exploitation. As the archiving of sequences through http://www.insdc.org/[International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INDSC)^] is a widespread norm in sequence-based research, publication of occurrence data originating from sequences does not involve publishing new sequences. In most cases these have already been placed in a public genetic repository. This guide therefore addresses the added value possible from deriving spatio-temporal occurrence data and dna-based names from dna data, rather than the value of the genetic information itself. In addition to dealing with sequence-derived data, this guide also includes suggestions for publishing occurrence data of species derived from qPCR or ddPCR analyses."

Thus, eDNA includes all DNA extracted from a specific environmental sample, regardless of substrate and which species it contains.

Environmental DNA often sufficiently represents all organisms in a given sample. In practice, however, the presence of DNA in the environmental sample depends on an organisms habitat selection, body size, morphology and activity level. Also, the sampling methods used to capture the DNA (https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198767220.001.0001[Taberlet et al. 2018^]) and the stage of DNA degradation can affect the presence of DNA."

However, studies will often include both types of sampling. For example, if the 'Reference Library' used in B) does not contain all relevant species from a given group of organisms, it will be necessary to go back to A).

Therefore, eDNA may be suitable for monitoring rare red list species and undesirable alien species that often have low densities and that are difficult to detect with conventional methods because sometimes DNA traces can still be detected, although the actual organism is no longer present there. Environmental DNA methods are able to detect cryptic organisms, especially those that are small and unable to be detected by the naked eye (e.g. bacteria and fungi).

The biodiversity data platforms support data discovery, access and reuse by making these individual datasets compatible with each other, addressing taxonomic, spatial and other inconsistencies in the available biodiversity data.

This is not to suggest that these are the best methods or most appropriate for all purposes but is an attempt to encourage submission of relatively standardized data that may readily be compared via the platforms. If possible, a well documented and maintained workflow should be used (e.g. https://nf-co.re/ampliseq[nf-core/ampliseq pipeline]). Metadata should include workflow details and versions either in the metadata method steps or as a reference in the SOP field in the DNA derived data extension (see mapping in <<table-04,Table 4>>). Sequence data should be deposited in an appropriate nucleotide archive (NCBI’s SRA: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq1019[Leinonen et al. 2011^]) or EMBL’s ENA (https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz1063[Amid et al. 2020^])) and data submitted to the biodiversity platform should include the biosample ID obtained from the archive (see data mapping in <<data-mapping>>). Making use of these sample IDs will reduce the chances of duplication and ensure sequence data are readily obtainable should opportunities for re-analysis arise, as reference libraries and bioinformatic tools improve. The core end-product of these pipelines is typically a file of counts of individual OTUs or ASVs in each sample along with the taxonomy assigned to these. This is generated either in tabular format or in the BIOM format (https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-1-7[McDonald et.al 2012^]).

These new representations include molecular reference databases (e.g., GTDB, BOLD, UNITE) that recognize sequence data as reference material for previously unclassified organisms.

Even more importantly, they vary in scale, from local study- or project-specific libraries to global databases that enable broader cross-study comparison. In contrast to the centralization and codification of Linnaean taxa that are formally described in research publications, OTUs are distributed across multiple evolving digital reference libraries that differ in taxonomic focus, barcode genes and other factors. By associating standard sequences with identified reference specimens, BOLD and UNITE are establishing an essential mapping layer for linking ASVs and OTUs with Linnaean taxonomy.

However, the inclusion of the underlying OTU or ASV sequence for each record will allow future users to potentially identify the sequence to a greater level of granularity, particularly as reference libraries improve over time. Therefore we also recommend to publish all sequences in a study - also those that are presently fully unclassified – as they may well be possible to identify with improved reference databases. In cases where the underlying sequence cannot be included as part of the submitted data, we advocate deposition of a (scientific or placeholder) name of the taxon (e.g. the BOLD BIN or UNITE SH) plus an MD5 checksum of the sequence as a unique taxon ID (see xref:data-mapping[xrefstyle=\"full\"]). MD5 checksums are unidirectional hash algorithms commonly used for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5[verifying file integrity^]. In this case, they would provide a unique and repeatable representation of the original sequence that would nevertheless not allow the sequence itself to be recovered. This may be required in cases where sensitivity exists around access. MD5 checksums enable efficient query to determine whether the same exact sequence has been recovered in other eDNA efforts, but it is not a complete replacement of the sequence as MD5s do not enable further analyses. Two sequences differing by even a single base will get two completely different MD5 checksums, such that BLAST-style sequence similarity searches will not work."

msgid "Data packaging and publishing pathways vary from platform to platform and are described in general documentation. One of the widespread ways to package data files is currently DwC-A, where data tables are arranged in a star schema, with records (rows) in peripheral extension files pointing to a single record in the central core file (<<figure-dwca-ipt>>). The different types of core files (e.g. occurrence and sampling-event) correspond to different classes of datasets. Although DNA-derived datasets often are event-based in nature, i.e. hundreds or even thousands of quantified sequence occurrences may derive from a single sampling event and thus share most metadata attributes, the current recommendation is to publish data as Occurrence core (Category I or II) with the DNA derived data extension. This approach compensates for limitations of the DwC star schema, which would not allow any occurrence-level data in extension files (such as processed barcode sequences) to point to records in an event core file. We do, however, recommend including an eventID for each core record, to indicate the association between occurrences derived from the same sampling event."

It is for example not possible to extend occurrences with DNA sequences if data are packaged using Event core."

In many cases this is straightforward, such as renaming your `lat` or `latitude` field to `decimalLatitude`. However, the Darwin Core Standard is quite flexible and some terms are used in different ways, depending on the type of data. An example of this are the fields term:dwc[organismQuantity] and term:dwc[organismQuantityType], which could be used to describe the number of individuals, per cent biomass or a score on the Braun-Blanquet Scale, as well as the number of reads of an ASV within a sample. Therefore, we here provide tables of required and recommended fields with descriptions and examples (<<table-01,Table 1>>, <<table-02,Table 2>>, <<table-03,Table 3>> and <<table-04, Table 4>>). The recommendation to use the Occurrence core for DNA-derived data stems from the strong desire to share the sequence to help qualify the determination. Additional fields and extensions (such as http://rs.gbif.org/extension/obis/extended_measurement_or_fact.xml[extended Measurement or Fact (eMoF)]) are applicable - both to occurrence cores and event core. When a sequence is derived from an organism (e.g. a parasite, gut contents, epibiont etc.) the observation may be linked to the observation of the host organism. This can be achieved using the (https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#resourcerelationship[Resource Relation extension^]) of Darwin Core (e.g. https://www.gbif.org/species/143610775/verbatim). Perhaps the most important recommendation is to use globally unique (when available) and other permanent identifiers for as many data fields and parameters as possible (in all ID fields in the tables below)."

msgid "When working with datasets originating in the marine environment, it is recommended that the information is published also in the https://obis.org[Ocean Biodiversity Information System^] (OBIS) in addition to GBIF. OBIS is a global biodiversity database, which is specialized in providing reliable and accessible data related to marine life and is a part of the IOC-UNESCO. Like GBIF, and ALA, OBIS uses the DwC-A format for data indexing and publishing. By publishing marine datasets through OBIS in addition to other biodiversity databases, the data can reach a broader audience, and diverse groups working in the field of marine biodiversity, as datasets in OBIS are often used for UN processes. With the focus on marine datasets, stringent quality controls on the data increase the reliability of the data and lead to small differences in what information is required for publishing in OBIS as opposed to GBIF."

#. type: Plain text
#: 200.en.adoc:737
msgid "To ensure consistent taxonomic nomenclature OBIS uses the https://www.marinespecies.org/[World Register of Marine Species^] (WoRMS) as the only taxonomic backbone. This is the case also for occurrences derived from genetic data; a scientific name linked to a scientific name ID from the WoRMS database is highly recommended information for publishing. If a scientific name ID is not provided, OBIS will try to match the scientific name with WoRMS during ingestion, but this should be avoided whenever possible. Scientific names not listed in WoRMS are acceptable, and will be submitted to WoRMS for review and possible inclusion in the register. Fully unclassified sequences are recommended to be classified as \"incertae sedis\", with the WoRMS `scientificNameID` urn:lsid:marinespecies.org:taxname:12. This will ensure correct interpretation by both GBIF and OBIS. Additionally, it is recommended that sequence identifiers from the used reference databases (e.g. Barcode index numbers: BINs from BOLD) be added in the `taxonConceptID` field of the occurrence core table. In this way OBIS will retain its taxonomic backbone based on WoRMS, while enabling linking to disparate reference sequence databases. Names from reference databases which are not strictly scientific names, can be added as `verbatimIdentification`. Automatic classification of species names can often be done through the WoRMS taxon match services and R packages like worrms and taxize. In the future, OBIS plans to periodically search and update the taxonomic assignments of submitted sequences as reference databases develop with time, so recording the sequence information linked to each occurrence is highly recommended."

OBIS performs additional quality checks related to marine data; e.g. that coordinates for strictly marine species are not on land, and that the depth value reported is in a reasonable range. Finally, it should be mentioned that in addition OBIS supports the use of the http://rs.gbif.org/extension/obis/extended_measurement_or_fact.xml[extended Measurement or Fact (eMoF)]. This extension allows linking environmental data and sampling facts to sampling events or occurrences, as well as biological measurements to occurrences in a flexible and standardized manner.

The latter is used by several bioinformatic tools (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-019-0209-9[QIIME2^], https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01541-09[Mothur^], https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btq461[USEARCH^] etc.), and hence could help publishers skip a step in converting data into DwC-A format.

The data formats suggested above could open opportunities for a richer classification of the types of evidence on which a specific occurrence record is based. However, for the time being there is a lack of an appropriate value in the BasisOfRecord vocabulary for these data types. We suggest, as a pragmatic immediate solution, that the BasisOfRecord is extended with a value such as “DNA”, “DNA-derived”, or similar. As described above, DNA-derived data may come from well-documented sampling or individual organisms, may be backed by preserved physical material or not, and may result from genetic sequencing or other DNA detection methods, such as qPCR. Biodiversity data platforms and TDWG should provide the means of differentiating between these data types and their origins."

msgid "UNITE is a web-based sequence management environment centred on the eukaryotic nuclear ribosomal ITS region. All public sequences are clustered into species hypotheses (SHs), which are assigned unique DOIs. An SH-matching service outputs various elements of information, including what species are present in eDNA samples, whether these species are potentially undescribed new species, other studies in which they were recovered, whether the species are alien to a region, and whether they are threatened. The DOIs are connected to the taxonomic backbone of the https://plutof.ut.ee/[PlutoF platform^] and https://www.gbif.org[GBIF^], such that they are accompanied by a taxon name where available. The data used in UNITE are hosted and managed in PlutoF. Data are represented through a range of standards, primarily https://dwc.tdwg.org/[Darwin Core^], https://gensc.org/mixs/[MIxS^], and https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard[DMP Common Standard^]; partial support is available for https://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards/eml-ecological-metadata-language[EML^], https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20211251/[MCL^], and https://terms.tdwg.org/wiki/GGBN_Data_Standard[GGBN^]. PlutoF exports data primarily through the CSV and FASTA formats. PlutoF can also be used to publish data in GBIF (using the DwC format) and to prepare GenBank submission files. It is furthermore possible to download species lists from your data and download your project as a https://www.json.org/json-en.html[JSON] document with project data in hierarchically structured."
