== Future prospects

The present interest in exposing DNA-derived data through biodiversity data platforms is very high, and it is very likely that the demand will grow. Our aim is for the mapping recommendations provided here to remain valid and evolve slowly, even as packaging and indexing by biodiversity data platforms develops more rapidly.

We suggest that data platforms such as ALA and GBIF work towards adopting data formats that support more complex relational and hierarchical data. Examples could be the https://frictionlessdata.io/[Frictionless Data Format^] and the more domain-specific https://biom-format.org/[Biological Observation Matrix^] (BIOM) format. The latter is used by several bioinformatic tools (QIIME, Mothur, USEARCH etc.), and hence could help publishers skip a step in converting data into DwC-A format. A more flexible data format than the current DwC star schema is crucial for allowing hierarchical sampling events and material samples as well as attaching sequence data to individual occurrences within a sampling event. 

Biodiversity data platforms will also need to enable researchers to easily include or exclude DNA-derived occurrence data from their query results. The data formats suggested above could open opportunities for a richer classification of the types of evidence on which a specific occurrence record is based. However, for the time being there is a lack of an appropriate value in the BasisOfRecord vocabulary for these data types. We suggest, as a pragmatic immediate solution, that the BasisOfRecord is extended with a value such as “DNA”, “DNA-derived”, or similar. As described above, DNA-derived data may come from well-documented sampling or individual organisms, may be backed by preserved physical material or not, and may result from genetic sequencing or other DNA detection methods, such as qPCR. Biodiversity data platforms and TDWG should provide the means of differentiating between these data types and their origins.

We also recommend that the data platforms index the actual sequences, or at least a MD5 checksum of these, to facilitate searches for ASVs across datasets. If ASVs are provided, MD5s should be generated by the biodiversity discovery platforms; if ASVs are not provided, MD5s need to be mandatory.

As mentioned in <<taxonomy-of-sequences>> and <<category-iv>>, we encourage the biodiversity data platforms to continue work on adopting relevant molecular taxonomic reference databases into their taxonomic backbones.

New and emerging methods and technologies, such as Oxford Nanopore, PacBio and shotgun sequencing, will likely trigger the need for adjustments to this guide to accommodate specific new data and metadata fields.
